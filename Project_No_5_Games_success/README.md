Project "The research of games success"

Historical data on game sales, user and expert ratings, genres and platforms (for example, Xbox or PlayStation) up to 2016 are available from open sources. It is necessary to identify patterns that determine the success of the game. This will allow you to identify a potentially popular product and plan advertising campaigns for the online store for 2017. The data set contains the abbreviation ESRB (Entertainment Software Rating Board), an association that determines the age rating of computer games. ESRB evaluates game content and assigns it a suitable age category, for example, "For adults", "For younger children" or "For teenagers".

Task details:
To solve this problem, we need to perform the following steps:

1) study the data and their specifics;

2) carry out their preliminary processing so that the results of the analysis reflect real patterns, and not distorted due to the presence of inaccuracies or errors in the data;

3) conducting research data analysis;

4) drawing up a portrait of the user of each region;

5) formation and verification of hypotheses;

6) the design of the general conclusion of the study.
