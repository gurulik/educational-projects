Description of the project "Defining of a promising tariff for a telecom company":

The company implements two tariff plans Smart and Ultra. To optimize the advertising budget of the company, it is necessary to determine which of the tariff plans is more profitable for the company. To solve this problem, it is necessary to analyze the available data on the behavior of 500 customers for 2018, taking into account information about the specifics of tariff plans.

Specifics of tariff plans:

1) Tariff "Smart" Monthly fee: 550 rubles.
Included: 500 minutes of conversation, 50 messages and 15 GB of Internet traffic. The cost of services in excess of the tariff package: a minute of conversation: 3 rubles; message: 3 rubles; 1 GB of Internet traffic: 200 rubles.

2) Tariff "Ultra" Monthly fee: 1950 rubles. 
Included: 3000 minutes of conversation, 1000 messages and 30 GB of Internet traffic. The cost of services in excess of the tariff package: a minute of conversation: 1 ruble; message: 1 ruble; 1 GB of Internet traffic: 150 rubles.

Time is always subject to rounding from seconds to minutes, and megabytes to gigabytes. Each call is rounded separately: even if it lasted only 1 second, it will be counted as 1 minute. For web traffic, individual sessions are not counted. Instead, the total amount for the month is rounded up. If a subscriber uses 1025 megabytes this month, they will be charged for 2 gigabytes. Please accept that unused calls, SMS, Internet for the previous month will not be transferred to the next month.
