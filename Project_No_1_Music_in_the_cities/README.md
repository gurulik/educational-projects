Yandex.Music
On the basis of Yandex.Music data, it is necessary to determine the behavior of users of the two cities.

The purpose of the study — test three hypotheses:

1) User activity depends on the day of the week. Moreover, in Moscow and St. Petersburg, this manifests itself in different ways.
2) On Monday morning, some genres prevail in Moscow, and others in St. Petersburg. Similarly, on Friday evening, different genres prevail — depending on the city.
3) Moscow and St. Petersburg prefer different genres of music. In Moscow, pop music is more often listened to, in St. Petersburg - Russian rap.

Research plan:

Data on user behavior must be obtained from the file yandex_music_project.csv. Nothing is known about the quality of the data. Therefore, a review of the data will be needed before testing hypotheses.

It is necessary to check the data for errors and evaluate their impact on the study. Then, at the preprocessing stage, we will correct the most critical data errors.
