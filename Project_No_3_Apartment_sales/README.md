Apartment sales research.

Data â€” the archive of ads for the sale of apartments in St. Petersburg and neighboring settlements for several years. There are two types of data available for each apartment for sale. The first ones are entered by the user, the second ones are obtained automatically based on cartographic data. For example, the distance to the center, the airport, the nearest park and reservoir.

The aim of this study is to analyze the archive of ads for the sale of apartments in St. Petersburg and neighboring settlements for several years in order to determine the parameters that affect the market value of real estate objects, which will serve to build an automated system that detects anomalies and fraudulent activity. To do this, it is necessary to solve the following tasks:

1) study the data and their specifics;

2) carry out their preliminary processing so that the results of the analysis reflect real patterns, and not distorted due to the presence of inaccuracies or errors in the data;

3) conducting research data analysis;

4) the design of the general conclusion of the study.
